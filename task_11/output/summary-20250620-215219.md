The patient, a healthy 25-year-old engineering student who works part-time as a postman, presents with sharp chest pain over the heart area lasting a few seconds at a time, ongoing for three days. The pain worsens with coughing and lying down but improves when leaning forward. It sometimes radiates to the neck and is rated 6/10 in intensity. The patient has no other symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or viral symptoms currently, though they recently recovered from the flu. There is no history of medical conditions, medications (except occasional Tylenol), allergies, surgeries, smoking, or drug use. The patient is concerned about a heart attack due to a recent family history—his father died of a heart attack two weeks ago. The clinician empathized with the patient’s concerns, reassured them, and plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate heart function and determine the cause of the pain. The patient was advised not to worry excessively until test results are available.
