ENIGMA TEST COVERAGE REPORT
===========================

Test Results:
-------------
PASS ./enigma.test.js

Enigma Machine
  ✓ Encrypts and decrypts with default settings (no plugboard, no ring, AAA) (3 ms)
  ✓ Encrypts and decrypts with plugboard pairs (1 ms)
  ✓ Encrypts and decrypts with non-zero rotor positions
  ✓ Encrypts and decrypts with non-zero ring settings (1 ms)
  ✓ Encrypts and decrypts with all settings combined
  ✓ Non-alphabetic characters are passed through unchanged (1 ms)
  ✓ Handles lowercase input by converting to uppercase
  ✓ Rotor stepping mechanism works correctly
  ✓ Double-stepping anomaly: middle rotor steps correctly (1 ms)
  ✓ Encrypts known plaintext to expected ciphertext
  ✓ Empty message returns empty string
  ✓ Plugboard swaps work bidirectionally (1 ms)
  ✓ Multiple rotor rotations work correctly
  ✓ Ring settings affect encryption output
  ✓ Same message encrypted twice with same settings produces same result

Coverage Requirements: ✓ PASSED
-------------------------------
All metrics exceed the required 60% threshold:
- Statements: 75.75% (required: 60%)
- Branches: 62.5% (required: 60%)
- Functions: 68.42% (required: 60%)
- Lines: 73.77% (required: 60%)

Note: Uncovered lines (66-67, 101-125, 133) are primarily the CLI prompt functionality, 
which is expected as tests focus on the core Enigma encryption/decryption logic.
