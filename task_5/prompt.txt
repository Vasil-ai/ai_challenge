Analyze two feedback:
1) Sensor just stops tracking for like a half second kinda often even at 8000hz. I've also tried it plugged in and still the same problem. First one I got I had to return also because the dongle just didnt work, $150 mouse btw
2) Is it worth it? It is a product with no flaws in my opinion, if you love it go for it, but its not worth the price since you'll be able to perform the same with a cheaper product with half the specs.

Use Few-Shot Prompting approach for analyzing. Get examples from EXAMPLES file

Use Chain-of-Thought based decision-making, it is importatnt for detecting of "isRelevant" field. Analyze the feedback only if it is relevant to the product. If not, set isRelevant to false and skip further analysis.

Provide your answer in JSON format with the following fields, values and structure:
{
  "sentiment": "string (Positive|Negative|Neutral|Mixed)",
  "isRelevant": boolean,
  "mainSubject": "string or null",
  "positives": ["array of strings"],
  "painPoints": ["array of strings"],
  "improvementSuggestions": ["array of strings"],
  "featuresMentioned": ["array of strings"],
  "userExpertise": "string (Experienced|Novice|Unknown)"
}
